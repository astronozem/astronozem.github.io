## Featured Project: Impulse Capture Tool

The **Impulse Capture Tool** is a web-based application for playing back sweeps and recording the response. It allows users to generate excitation signals (log sweep, impulse, or noise burst), capture audio via a microphone, and save recordings as 24-bit WAV files.

- **Live Demo**: [https://astronozem.github.io/impulse-capture/](https://astronozem.github.io/impulse-capture/)
- **Source Code**: [impulse-capture/](impulse-capture/)
- **Usage**:
  1. Visit the live demo link above.
  2. Click "Start Audio" to enable microphone access, allow microphone access.
  3. Select a signal type, duration, and level.
  4. Hold the "Record / Play Signal" button to play the signal and capture audio.
  5. Release when the tail is done.
  6. Save or normalize the recorded WAV file.

**Warning**: Audio sweeps can be loud. Ensure safe volume levels to protect hearing and equipment.
